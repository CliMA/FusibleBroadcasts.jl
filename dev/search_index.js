One definition replaces all arguments that have @fuse annotations with FusibleBroadcastAccumulators, while the other definition replaces them with UnfusibleBroadcastEvaluators. If an annotated argument in the original definition is restricted to some type T, the new methods are restricted to FusibleBroadcastAccumulator{T} and UnfusibleBroadcastEvaluator{T}.\n\nThis macro can be thought of as an analogue of @simd that operates at the level of broadcast expressions. Using this macro amounts to telling the compiler that the body of the method definition satisfies the following constraints:\n\nall broadcasts are in-place\nall broadcast destinations are either an arguments annotated with @fuse or components of annotated arguments, and they are not aliased by other names\nall broadcasts can be freely rearranged, regardless of any changes to floating point round-off error this may cause\nall non-broadcast operations on arguments annotated with @fuse will always yield the same results when evaluated on inputs with some particular types\n\nThe first two constraints are checked automatically, but users should ensure that they satisfy the other constraints when marking a method as @fusible.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"macro"},{"location":"api/#FusibleBroadcasts.@lazy_dot-Tuple{Any}","page":"API","title":"FusibleBroadcasts.@lazy_dot","text":"@lazy_dot <expression>\n\nRoughly equivalent to @., but without the call to Base.materialize that gets inserted during the code lowering process.\n\nReturns a FusibleBroadcasted object that lazily represents the computations in the given expression.

This argument only needs to be specified if the wrapper is going to be passed to unwrap, in which case the default value of UnknownDestination will cause an error to be thrown. For an UnfusibleBroadcastEvaluator, dest should be the destination itself, but, for a FusibleBroadcastAccumulator, it only has to be similar to the final FusedBroadcast destination.\n\nThe second constructor argument, warn_on_unwrap, which is set to false by default, toggles whether a warning will be logged when the wrapper is passed to unwrap (except for when this occurs in one of several common functions like propertynames and eltype, which are easily extended to LazyOrEagerWrappers with well-defined destinations). This argument only needs to be specified when dest is specified, since an UnknownDestination will always cause unwrap to throw an error. A LazyOrEagerWrapper gets unwrapped whenever it is passed from a user-defined method annotated with @fusible to one that is not annotated, so this toggle can be used to check whether all of the broadcasts executed by a block of code appear within annotated methods and can be handled by a FusibleBroadcastAccumulator, or if some need to be handled separately by an UnfusibleBroadcastEvaluator.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"api/#FusibleBroadcasts.MaximizeFusion","page":"API","title":"FusibleBroadcasts.MaximizeFusion","text":"MaximizeFusion()\n\nThe default FusibleBroadcastOptimizer.
